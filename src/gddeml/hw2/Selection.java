/**
 * N people go to a Casino and everyone wins a little bit of money. You suggest it would be 
 * better if just one person collected all the winnings and you propose the following strategy.
 * 
 * 1. You tell everyone to stand in a circle (yourself included)
 * 2. You ask someone to volunteer to be the start. That is person #1. In clockwise fashion,
 *    everyone in the circle is assigned a number from 1 to N.
 * 3. You pick a number 0 < k < N.
 * 
 * Starting with the starting person, count k people clockwise. The kth person leaves the circle
 * which shrinks by one in size; starting with the next person, again count k people clockwise
 * and that person leaves the circle.
 * 
 * The last one remaining collects all winnings.
 * 
 * Your program must produce a FixedCapacityQueue<Integer> reflecting the order in which people
 * are eliminated. The final item in the queue is the person who collects all winnings.
 * 
 * Your implementation MUST create a Linked List using the Node class.
 * 
 * For new Selection(5, 3).countOff(), the resulting queue should be [3 1 5 2 4] where last person to receive
 * winnings is person #4.
 * 
 * For new Selection(17, 7).countOff(), the resulting queue should be [7 14 4 12 3 13 6 17 11 9 8 10 16 5 15 1 2] where
 * last person to receive winnings is person #2.
