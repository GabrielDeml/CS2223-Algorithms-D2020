/**
 * For this question, you are to process the book "The Tale of Two Cities" as included in the repository.   
 * 
 * There are 45 chapters in the book, which I have extracted into separate files. I will admit that the  
 * transcription is quite awkward. For example, everything has been converted to lower case, and all punctuation 
 * marks have been removed. Some words are subdivided improperly, but this is what we have to work with!
 * 
 * The questions you are to answer are:
 * 
 * 1. Which chapter contains the most # of words in total, as returned by the TaleOfTwoCitiesExtractor
 * 2. Which chapter (of the 45) contains the most # of unique words? and how many unique words occur in
 *    that chapter.
 * 3. Which two distinct chapters share the most words in common? And how many words is that?
 * 
 * The definition of a word is given to you by the TaleOfTwoCitiesExtractor class, which provides an
 * Iterable interface to a given chapter. This object will return the words in a chapter, one at a time,
 * in the order they appear in the chapter.
 * 
 * Your first responsibility is to ensure that TaleOfTwoCitiesExtractor works in your location.
